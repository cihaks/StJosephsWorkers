BusyAjax v1.1
=============

Description
===========

All projects can benefit by having a simple ajax spinner that follows the mouse when ajax calls are being made by the browser in the background. Gives the user a better experience, and saves you from coding it into every "ajaxified" view.

Repo is http://github.com/ssoroka/busy_ajax/tree/master

Usage
=====
script/plugin install git://github.com/ssoroka/busy_ajax.git

in your document <head> put <%= javascript_include_tag 'busy_ajax' %>

That's it!!

If you had a pre-v0.2 copy of the project, You no longer need <%= busy_ajax %> in your project.

New in v1.1
===========

- bug was causing spinner to never be displayed. :(  You'd think I would have caught that sooner.

New in v1.0
===========

- made BusyAjaxClass, moved everything there. Now plays nice in global namespace.
- renamed busy_on() and busy_off() to enable() and disable() methods of BusyAjaxClass. 
  Accessible through busy_ajax.enable(); or busy_ajax.disable();

New in v0.3
===========

- Moved project to github. :)

New in v0.2
===========

- New busy_off(); and busy_on(); javascript methods to turn the busy indicator on and off dynamically.
An RJS example of that is:
	page.call 'busy_off'

- busy_ajax method is removed from layout, div is now added dynamically with javascript, very unobtrusive!

- Generally much cleaner.
